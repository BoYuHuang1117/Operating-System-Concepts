# Operating-System-Concepts

### Project 1 is about fork system call.

- using for loop to create five children process
- identify the order of each children process
- parent process waits until all the children processes terminates

### Project 2 is about v6-file system

> main function

- *initfs(filepath, # of blocks, # of I-nodes)*

  This function initializes the v6-file system. All data blocks are in the free list except the root block.

- *cpin(externalfile, v6-file)*

- *cpout(v6-file, externalfile)*

- *q*

  This command saves all changes and quit.
